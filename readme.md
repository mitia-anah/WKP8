# WKP8 

## 1.structure
        In this project, I've put some comments on every function to explain the meaning of the code. Then I started to work on each line of the function. I grabbed all the elements that I need first and after that I worked on each one of the function.

## To improve
2. I couldn't manage to finish the project as the I ran out of time, but if I had more time, I would work on the filtering part, deleting button is not working too so I would fix  that as well.

## New thing to learn
The truth is, I could have learnt new thing with this project if I were able to finish it until the end.

## challenging part
4. The most challenging part for me was the to get the deleting button working. In addition 
, the link of the image url doesn't appear in the browser when I add it to the "hit parade". I stuck on that for more than an hour. Intead, I use image element, and commented out the real url.
